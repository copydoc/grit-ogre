	/** Instance of a Skeleton, main external interface for retrieving bone positions and applying
		animations.
    @remarks
		The new SkeletonInstance uses SIMD to animate up to 4 bones at the same time, though
		this depends on the number of bones on each parent level depth in the hierachy.
	@par
		I.e. if there is 1 root bone with 6 child bones; the root node will be animated solo,
		the first 4 child bones will be animated at the same time, and the 2 last bones
		will be animated together in the next loop iteration.
	@par
		Note however, when updating bones in the hierarchy to obtain the derived transforms
		(rather than animating), the root bone will be updated together using SIMD with the
		root bones from 3 other SkeletonInstances that share the same SkeletonDef.
		Only animating them has this restriction.
		The animation system won't be able to "share" though, if the SkeletonDef had 3 root
		nodes instead of 1; because we need to put them in a SIMD block in a repeating
		pattern And repeating 3 bones at least twice gives 6 bones, which doesn't fit in
		SSE2 (though it should in AVX, where ARRAY_PACKED_REALS = 8)

		To those interested in the original repository of OgreAnimation to obtain full
		history, go to:
